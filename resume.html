                <p>John has a grave passion for Artworks. He discovered this drive for drawing and painting from a very
                  tender age. As a young boy, he drew and painted lots of pictures. Notably, he drew and painted the old
                  fifty kobo note which appeared so real to many people. This unusual drive and talent spurred him into
                  choosing to study Fine and Applied Arts in the higher institution where he majored in Graphics Design.
                  Before joining the ministry, John-Otaka had Art as a full-time business. He was fully into the business
                  of drawing, painting and graphics. Upon becoming a minister of the gospel, he continued in the pursuit
                  of his talent while doing the kingdom business. He also uses his gift to support ministers and
                  ministries by drawing and designing for them. He has tons of artworks to his credit both for
                  individuals, organizations, and ministries.
